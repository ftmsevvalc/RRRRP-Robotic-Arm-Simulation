# RRRP Robotic Arm Simulation

This repository presents the kinematic modeling and simulation of a RRRP-type robotic manipulator
using MATLAB Robotics System Toolbox. The focus of the project is on rigid body modeling,
joint definition, collision geometry, and visualization of robotic arm motion.

## Project Description
The robotic system consists of:
- A rotating base
- Three revolute joints (RRR)
- One prismatic joint (P)
- A simple gripper model

Each link is modeled as a rigid body, and collision geometries are defined to enable
realistic visualization and potential collision analysis.

## Methodology
- Rigid body tree construction
- Definition of revolute and prismatic joints
- Assignment of joint axes and fixed transforms
- Collision object modeling (cylinders and boxes)
- Visualization of the robotic arm with collision geometries

## Tools & Technologies
- MATLAB
- Robotics System Toolbox
- Rigid body modeling
- Forward kinematics
- Simulation and visualization

## Purpose
This project was developed for educational and engineering practice purposes to strengthen
understanding of robotic kinematics, rigid body modeling, and simulation workflows.
It is independent of any thesis or confidential research work.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with robotic manipulator modeling
- Understanding of joint configurations and transformations
- Simulation-based validation of robotic structures
- Engineering-oriented problem formulation

## Notes
This repository demonstrates fundamental robotics concepts and is intended as a
portfolio project showcasing modeling and simulation skills.
